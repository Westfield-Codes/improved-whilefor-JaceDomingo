/* STAGE 1:ASK A QUESTION */

/* askQuestion asks a multiplication question, returns 1 if incorrect
 * @param: question (integer 1-5)
 * @return: integer (0 or 1)

/* STAGE 1:ASK 5 QUESTIONS */

/* askFive calls askQuestion five times, counting and returning number wrong
 * @param: none
 * @return: score (0-5)

/* TEST BEFORE CONTINUING TO STAGE THREE! */

/* STAGE 3: MULTIPLE TRIES (CHALLENGE!) */

/* Refactor askQuestion per whileQuestions askFive calls askQuestion five times, counting and returning number wrong
 * Use the whileQuestions tab in the flowchart to guide you. 
 * @param: none
 * @return: score (0-5)
